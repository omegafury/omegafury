### Hi, I'm Poe  ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer with full stack experience doing data analytics on the web for some of the largest Oil and Gas customers in the world. Before that I was a staff sergeant in the US Air Force for six years, where I was lucky enough to get a lot of world travel during that time.  I'm at my best with a difficult problem to solve, and a great team to support and vice versa.
